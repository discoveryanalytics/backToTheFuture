      The Rolls-Royce AE 3007 is a high-bypass turbofan engine produced by
      Rolls-Royce North America, sharing a common core with the Rolls-Royce T406
      (AE 1107) and AE 2100.AE 3007 divided into 25 zones for the heat rejection
      model [6] The skin temperature predicted for a zone is compared against
      the hot surface ignition database to produce what is referred to as a
      minimum hot surface ignition temperature or MHSIT margin [6]. The margin
      is the predicted skin temperature subtracted from the database
      temperature. The nozzle produces droplets in the 50 micron range
      (consistent with the expected droplet size of the Wright-Patterson rig),
      and was injected at the scaled rate of 1.1 mLs for a duration of 5 seconds
      with a driving pressure of 125 psia. Ignition was first achieved at a
      surface condition of 843. The air velocity was .35 m/s and the air
      temperature was 106C. The results are summarized in the table below.

  - context: |
      AE 3007 divided into 25 zones for the heat rejection model [6] The skin temperature predicted for a zone is compared against the hot surface ignition database to produce what is referred to as a minimum hot surface ignition temperature or MHSIT margin [6]. The margin is the predicted skin temperature subtracted from the database temperature. Positive margins are associated with engine safety. The ignition temperature referenced from the database considers multiple factors including: leak fluid, local air temperature, local air velocity, pressure, and leak type (spray or stream)

  - context: |
      The engines will be repaired in accordance with (IAW) applicable AE 2100D3 Technical Order (T.O.) requirements. This requirement also entails receiving, handling, transporting, storage, inspecting, non-destructive inspection (NDI), repair, overhaul, performance testing, functional testing, pre/post bore-scope inspections and engine preservation. Scheduled and unscheduled depot maintenance, analytical condition inspection, engine mishap investigation support and maintenance data systems management are within the scope of this requirement.

        answer: |
          TAE2100D3
      - question: What is NDI?
        answer: |
          non-destructive inspection (NDI)
      - question: What is analytical condition inspection of AE series?
        answer: |
          analytical condition inspection is the behaviour analysis of on boarded sensor data

      The Rolls-Royce AE 3007 (US military: F137) is a high-bypass turbofan engine produced by 
      Rolls-Royce North America shares a common core with the Rolls-Royce T406 (AE 1107) and AE 2100.
      AE 3007 is divided into 25 zones for the heat rejection model [6] The skin temperature predicted for a zone 
      is compared against the hot surface ignition database to produce what is referred to as a minimum hot surface ignition temperature or MHSIT margin [6]. 
      The margin is the predicted skin temperature subtracted from the database temperature. The nozzle produces droplets in the 50 micron range (consistent with the expected droplet size of the Wright-Patterson rig), and was injected at the scaled rate of 1.1 mL/s for a duration of 5 seconds with a driving pressure of 125 psia. Ignition was first achieved at a surface condition of 843±3°C. The air velocity was .35±.01 m/s and the air temperature was 106±15°C. The results are summarized in the table below.
      Positive margins are associated with engine safety. The ignition temperature referenced from the database considers multiple factors including leak fluid, local air temperature, local air velocity, pressure, and leak type (spray or stream).

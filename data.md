The AE Family of Engines are a collection of Rolls-Royce engines that share a common core and are ~80% common in their parts makeup. These engines power C-130J Hercules (AE 2100D3), RQ-4 Global Hawk (F137) and V-22 Osprey (AE 1107C) & AE3007C

The Rolls-Royce AE 3007 (US military: F137) is a high-bypass turbofan engine produced by Rolls-Royce North America, sharing a common core with the Rolls-Royce T406 (AE 1107) and AE 2100.

The threat of hot surface ignition and its underlying causes are a source of ongoing concern for the aircraft and automotive industries. Property losses attributable to motor vehicle fires total in excess of 1 billion dollars annually in the U.S. alone [1]. Moreover, at least two-thirds of these fires can be traced back to vehicle engine compartments [1], where hot manifold surfaces and numerous fuel lines often exist in close proximity to one another. Dramatic reminders of the dangers of hot surface ignition in aircraft are found in both recent and not so recent headlines. The explosion of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 in July of 1996 was a fatal and costly disaster that resulted in the loss of 230 lives [2]. It was concluded during the subsequent investigation that the explosion was the result of a flammable mixture of fuel and air inside the aircraft’s center wing fuel tank being subject to tremendous heat transfer rates due to the tanks contact with the surface of the hot, air conditioning packs located directly below [2]. In November 2010, Qantas Flight 32 was forced to make an emergency landing when a ruptured lubricant line led to an oil fire in one of the aircraft’s Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines [3].

When evaluating the minimum hot surface ignition temperature of an aircraft fluid, Rolls-Royce applies a heat rejection model to predict engine skin temperature [6]. The heat rejection model subdivides the engine into cylindrical zones of interests, and calculates a single expected skin temperature for each zone. The average zone length is between 4 and 5 inches. The model incorporates one dimensional conduction through the core engine casing as well as the inner and outer bleed air ducts [6]. The effects of conduction propagate across zones, but radiation and convection are specifically treated for the cylindrical control volume of a single zone.

AE 3007 divided into 25 zones for the heat rejection model [6] The skin temperature predicted for a zone is compared against the hot surface ignition database to produce what is referred to as a minimum hot surface ignition temperature or MHSIT margin [6]. The margin is the predicted skin temperature subtracted from the database temperature. Positive margins are associated with engine safety. The ignition temperature referenced from the database considers multiple factors including: leak fluid, local air temperature, local air velocity, pressure, and leak type (spray or stream).

Skin temperatures compared against database MHSIT for JP-8/Jet-A [6] Despite its usefulness, the current database presents a number of frustrations for RollsRoyce. In the database, air velocities never exceed 11 ft/s. This is almost a full order of magnitude lower than velocities observed inside the engine nacelle. The database contains data that was taken over 2 decades ago. Some fluids that appear in the database, such as JP-4, have been phased out of general use while modern aircraft fluids such as the MIL-PRF-23699, a new lubricating oil, do not appear at all. The hot surface ignition project at Purdue is intended to redress these issues.

Fundamentals of Hot Surface Ignition Throughout the course of the literature review, multiple sources stressed the inherent differences between auto-ignition and hot surface ignition [7-9]. Thermal ignition is broadly understood to be the result of a combustible mixture (either with or without an external heating source) undergoing an exothermic reaction such that the heat release from reaction overcomes the heat losses to the surrounding environment [10]. This is modeled in theories by both Semenov [10] and Frank-Kamenetskii [10]. Semenov applied his approach to a gas mixture and assumed the rate of chemical reaction adheres to the Arrhenius law, with W representing a molar rate per unit volume. 𝑊𝑊 = 𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛 −𝐸𝐸𝑎𝑎 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 � [Eq. 2-1] In equation 2-1, Z is the pre-exponential factor, c is the initial reactant concentration, Ea is the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature of the system. The heating rate from chemical reaction was thus: 𝑄𝑄𝑐𝑐ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 = 𝑉𝑉∆𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟 ° 𝑍𝑍𝑐𝑐𝑛𝑛 −𝐸𝐸𝑎𝑎 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 � [Eq. 2-2] The heat of reaction per mole is ∆𝐻𝐻𝑟𝑟 ° and V is the total system volume. Semenov modeled the heat loss to the surroundings [10] in the general formal of Newton’s law of cooling. 𝑄𝑄𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = ℎ(𝑇𝑇 − 𝑇𝑇𝑤𝑤)𝐴𝐴 [Eq. 2-3]

The left-hand expression is the heating rate for the system. The first term on the right is the heating rate from chemical release, and the final expression is of the conduction heat loss at the system boundaries [10]. To an extent, the differences in Semenov’s and FrankKamenetskii’s approaches to ignition theory parallels the differences between auto-ignition and hot surface ignition. The auto-ignition temperature of a flammable fluid is determined under a well-documented standard, ASTM E659 [11]. To find auto-ignition temperature, a carefully metered sample of flammable liquid is inserted into a uniformly heated, 500 mL glass flask at ambient pressure.

The nozzle produces droplets in the 50 micron range (consistent with the expected droplet size of the Wright-Patterson rig), and was injected at the scaled rate of 1.1 mL/s for a duration of 5 seconds with a driving pressure of 125 psia. Ignition was first achieved at a surface condition of 843±3°C. The air velocity was .35±.01 m/s and the air temperature was 106±15°C. The results are summarized in the table below.

It is evident from figure 5.2 that the flame initiated at the Inconel surface very quickly propagates back to the nozzle head. This was a result of the flame speed easily exceeding the air velocity at these low flow rates and the nozzle face being placed too close to the Inconel target (~2mm away). Also gathered from these initial tests was the considerable drift in the measured air temperature. This was reduced notably in later experimental trials as the testing became more streamlined, and the researchers gained greater familiarity with the response of the rig’s systems. To more closely observe the degree to which air temperature and air velocity affect the hot surface ignition temperature, a new flight of data was targeted for the elevated air temperature of 149°C. This serves as the first new addition to the hot surface ignition database established at Wright-Patterson by more closely observing the fundamental effects elevated temperature and velocity have on JP-8 sprayed upstream of the hot surface. Under a modified test arrangement, JP-8 is now sprayed 6.5 inches upstream of the surface leading edge and is directly ported into the wall of the Octagonal Duct. This has the effect of forcing the flame to travel farther to propagate to the nozzle face and allowing the injectant spray more space to atomize and distribute inside the test section. The liquid flowrate and duration is unchanged from the previous experiment

The engines will be repaired in accordance with (IAW) applicable AE 2100D3 Technical Order (T.O.) requirements. This requirement also entails receiving, handling, transporting, storage, inspecting, non-destructive inspection (NDI), repair, overhaul, performance testing, functional testing, pre/post bore-scope inspections and engine preservation. Scheduled and unscheduled depot maintenance, analytical condition inspection, engine mishap investigation support and maintenance data systems management are within the scope of this requirement.

Overhaul/Repair also involves management of repairable spares, storage of engines, serviceable spares, transition support, consumable materials, and material procurement. The maintenance program for the AE 2100D3 engine is based on the principles of "Reliability Centered Maintenance" (RCM). All maintenance performed shall be based on: the actual condition of the item as determined by inspection; the likely time to failure of the assemblies (sub-assemblies) once returned to service; testing; storage; occurrence of a specific event; or the expiration of operating time limits which themselves are based upon previously determined conditions. These will be prescribed by the applicable AE 2100D3 T.O.s and Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO's).
